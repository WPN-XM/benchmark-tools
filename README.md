# benchmark-tools

This repository provides some webserver benchmarking tools for Windows.

Some of the tools are only available as part of bigger packages, while others are simply hard to get.

The releases section of this repository contains the tools as standalone downloads and as packages for the WPN-XM server stack.
The packages for the WPN-XM server stack ship additional helpers and testing endpoints to execute the benchmark tools
in a repeatable fashion.
